# NoteBookUni
The main objective of this project is to develop an Android application, by reusing as much as possible the concepts,
methods and tools presented in the Principles of Software Development course.
The goal of this application is to help kids (or other users) to keep track of new words in a foreign
language that they are trying to learn.
Let us take an example. Imagine that Juliet, a French speaking girl, is learning english. The goal is to develop an
app which can be used by Juliet to write new learnt words in english and their corresponding translation in French.
In the past, Juliet was using a notebook with alphabetical tabs such as illustrated in Figure 1. Juliet would like
to use now an app to store the learnt words.

More specifically, the application contain the following features:
• The app propose a view for each letter of the alphabet;
• The user is able to edit the list of words;
• The user is able to export or import a list of words;
• An “exam” mode is proposed to test if the user knows the tranlsation of the words (for instance with
multiple choice questions);
